description: >-
  Cross-document drift audit for a math manuscript via run-audit.sh: R1 working-file path leaks (a working filepath accidentally typeset in main.tex), R2 citation/bib drift and orphans, R3 code-vs-manuscript symbol drift, R4 proposition-iso bijection. Checks consistency across main.tex + propositions/*.jsonl + analysis/*.py + refs.bib. Use after a large rewrite, before submission, or entering a new stage (submission / major revision / camera-ready) — NOT per-PR (that's a hook + CI). The cross-artifact axis — distinct from /propositions:propositions (in-file JSONL gate) and /propositions:proofread (per-prop semantic walk).

# Manuscript Audit — Cross-Doc Drift Detection

Full SOP (triggers, known patterns, report contract):
[`../../rules/manuscript-consistency-audit.md`](../../rules/manuscript-consistency-audit.md).

## Resolve the bundled orchestrator

```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(ls -d "$HOME"/.claude/plugins/cache/propositions-projects/propositions/*/ 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)}"
RUNNER="$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/run-audit.sh"
[ -f "$RUNNER" ] || { echo "run-audit.sh not found under $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/"; exit 2; }

MANUSCRIPT_ROOT="${1:-manuscript/}"      # dir holding main.tex + propositions/, not a single file
[ -d "$MANUSCRIPT_ROOT" ] || { echo "manuscript root not found at $MANUSCRIPT_ROOT — pass as arg 1"; exit 2; }
```

## R1-R4 coverage (frozen contract)

| Rule | Detects | Auto-allowlist |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **R1** symbols | `\texttt{path/to/working/file.ext}` working-file leak in main.tex; `note (<date>).tex` working-note refs | `\bibliography{refs.bib}`, commented `% …` lines |
| **R2** citations | `\cite{X}` where X not in refs.bib; cite-label leak (`\citet[Theorem~\texttt{main_thm_ess}]{Foo2020}` citing an internal LaTeX label as if it were a published theorem number); bib orphans | `@article{X,…}` keys auto-scanned; sibling working notes via `--latex-source-root` |
| **R3** code↔manuscript | backtick code refs `` `foo_func` `` in `manuscript/docs/*.md` not found in `analysis/*.py` AST | LaTeX `\label{}` / `\cite{}` keys, `@article` bib keys, sibling `references/**/*.tex` |
| **R4** proposition-iso | prop-jsonl bijection failure (feeds the R1-R13 validator; PATTERN-A boundary-axiom contradiction) | active only when `propositions/main.jsonl` exists; legacy `main.json` accepted as fallback |

R1/R2/R4 are blocking (they gate the PR CI in the manuscript repo); R3 is informational.

## Excluded paths (frozen audit trail — never modified retroactively)

- `manuscript/docs/rounds/` — review-round audit log
- `manuscript/docs/legacy/` — retired drafts
- `correspondence/` — email archive
- `references/*.tex` — historical reference papers
- `archive/` / `archived/` (also guarded by the archive-first plugin)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Pre-flight — clean working tree

Concurrent editing races produce phantom drift. Confirm the tree is clean first:

```bash
( cd "$MANUSCRIPT_ROOT" && git status --short )     # expect empty
( cd "$MANUSCRIPT_ROOT" && git submodule status )   # manuscript pointer correct
```

If dirty, ask whether to commit/stash before running.

### Step 2: Run the orchestrator

```bash
bash "$RUNNER" "$MANUSCRIPT_ROOT"                  # R3 defaults --code-root to analysis/
# If code lives elsewhere:   bash "$RUNNER" "$MANUSCRIPT_ROOT" --code-root path/to/code
```

`run-audit.sh` runs R1+R2+R3+R4 in order, writes a merged report to
`$MANUSCRIPT_ROOT/docs/audit/audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md`, and exits `0` clean / `1` ≥1 finding /
`2` tool error. Note: R3 requires the `--code-root` directory to exist (default `analysis/`);
a manuscript with no code should point `--code-root` at an existing dir or expect exit 2 from
that pass.

### Step 3: Review findings

Read `$MANUSCRIPT_ROOT/docs/audit/audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

- **Definite / Likely** → must fix, or make a conscious decision not to and record why
- **Suspicious / FYI** → review; most are ignorable

### Step 4: Per-finding triage (AskUserQuestion when the batch ≥ 10)

| Severity | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Definite + Likely | file an `audit-finding` issue (`scope:manuscript` label) in the manuscript repo |
| Suspicious | audit report only, no issue |
| FYI | audit report only |

False-positive suppression (per the SOP): LaTeX `\label{}` / `\cite{}` / bib keys and sibling
`references/*.tex` are auto-allowlisted; add more dirs with `--latex-source-root <path>`.

## Report format (frozen, per SOP §7)

The orchestrator emits a dated report headed by the manuscript git snapshot and per-pass exit
codes, a Summary table (Definite / Likely / Suspicious / FYI counts across R1-R3, plus R4
error/warning counts), then the full per-pass findings. Each Definite/Likely finding carries
Rule, `file:line` location, ±2 lines of context, a proposed fix, and a tracking-issue number
if filed.

## Trigger cadence

| Stage | Trigger | Frequency |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| after a large rewrite | manual `bash run-audit.sh manuscript/` | episode-based |
| before submission | manual | episode-based |
| per-PR touching main.tex / analysis / refs.bib | pre-commit hook (manuscript repo) | per-commit |
| per-PR, any change | GitHub Actions CI (manuscript repo) | per-PR |

The hook and CI layers live in the manuscript repo (not this plugin); this skill is the
manual full-audit entry point that the same `run-audit.sh` backs.

## When NOT to use

- Per-line edit → the `/propositions:propositions` R1-R13 validator + sync rule is faster
- Pure code-only change (no manuscript edit) → CI auto-skips via a paths filter
- Pre-extraction phase (no `propositions/main.jsonl`) → R4 auto-skips, but R1/R2/R3 still useful

## Cross-link

- `/propositions:propositions` — in-file JSONL R1-R13 validation (R4 here reuses that validator)
- `/propositions:proofread` — per-prop L4 semantic walk
- Rule [`../../rules/manuscript-consistency-audit.md`](../../rules/manuscript-consistency-audit.md) — full SOP
- Rule [`../../rules/code-and-manuscript-sync.md`](../../rules/code-and-manuscript-sync.md) — the per-PR hook/CI discipline this complements
